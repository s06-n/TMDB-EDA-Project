This report explores a movie dataset to draw insights and visualise findings. This report begins by exploring the patterns within the dataset, and then focuses on popularity of films and their genres. 

The objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset structure and identify trends to inform future analysis and potential applications like a recommendation system.

This report is split into the following sections:
- 01: Data Checking and Cleaning
- 02: Initial Exploration of Data
- 03: Detailed analysis of Popularity and Genre
- 04: Conclusions
